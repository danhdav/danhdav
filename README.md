# About Me

I'm an avid tech enthusiast and user of free and open source software.
Hence, although my academic projects are located here, my dotfiles and everything else will be on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/danhdav).

Currently, I am still exploring opportunities and a wide variety of technologies, so I won't settle down within a certain domain, nor within technology as a career in general.

# Contact Me
Iâ€™m not on Twitter, Iâ€™m not on Facebook, Iâ€™m not on Reddit, Iâ€™m not on Snapchat, etc.
My goal is to completely eliminate all forms of social media and start self-hosting. Yes, that goes for LinkedIn soon.
